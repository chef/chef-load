# Ignored if data_collector_url is not set.
# num_actions = 30

# This prefix will go at the beginning of each node name.
# This enables running multiple instances of chef-load without affecting each others' nodes
# For example, a value of "chef-load" will result in nodes named "chef-load-1", "chef-load-2", ...
# node_name_prefix = "chef-load"

# Chef environment used for each node

# run_list is the run list used for each node. It should be a list of strings.
# For example: run_list = [ "role[role_name]", "recipe_name", "recipe[different_recipe_name@1.0.0]" ]
# The default value is an empty run_list.
# run_list = [ ]

# Alternatively, you can provide several run lists which will be chosen randomly on each run.
# TODO future - allow weighting to determine frequency of each run list
# If this value is provided, run_list is ignored.

# download_cookbooks controls which chef-client run downloads cookbook files.
# Options are: "never", "first" (first chef-client run only), "always""

# download_cookbooks_scale_factor = 1.0


# api_get_requests is an optional list of API GET requests that are made during the chef-client run.
# This is used to simulate the API requests that the cookbooks would make.
# For example, it can make Chef Search or data bag item requests.
# The values can be either full URLs that include the chef_server_url portion or just the portion of
# the URL that comes after the chef_server_url.
# For example, to make a Chef Search API request that searches for all nodes you can use either of the
# following values:
#
# "https://chef.example.com/organizations/orgname/search/node?q=*%253A*&sort=X_CHEF_id_CHEF_X%20asc&start=0"

# This value represents the version of the Chef Client making the API requests. The default is "13.2.20"
# chef_version = "13.2.20"

# Ever since Chef Client 12.x was released the default behavior has been for the Chef Client to create its
# own client key locally and then upload the public side to the Chef Server when it creates the client object.
# chef-load simulates this behavior. However, if you want chef-load to ask the Chef Server to create a client key
# when the client object is created then set chef_server_creates_client_key to true.
# chef_server_creates_client_key = false

# is ignored.
# skip_client_creation = false

# Frequency with which old nodes are no longer used and new nodes (and clients)
