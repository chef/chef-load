# 1800 nodes / 30 minute interval = 60 chef-client runs per minute
# num_nodes = 30
# interval = 30

# The default value is an empty run_list.

# sleep_duration is measured in seconds

# download_cookbooks controls which chef-client run downloads cookbook files.
# Options are: "never", "first" (first chef-client run only), "always"
#
# Downloading cookbooks can significantly increase the number of API requests that chef-load
# makes depending on the run_list.
#
# Normal TCP protocol requires the connections to be in TIME-WAIT for about two minutes and it is
# recommended that the system's TIME-WAIT parameter's do not get changed.
# Ref: http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2014-tcp-time-wait-state-linux.html
#
# If chef-load makes enough API requests then the number of connections can increase until
# the system runs out of ephemeral ports resulting in connect(2) error EADDRNOTAVAIL.
# Ref: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man2/connect.2freebsd.html
# Ref: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man7/ip.7.html
#
# If you aren't concerned with simulating the download of cookbook files then the recommendation is
# to use "never" or "first".
#
# If you want to use "always" and you run out of ephemeral ports then consider increasing the range of
# ephemeral ports or reducing load by reducing the requests_per_minute setting.
# Ref: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-increase-outgoing-network-sockets-range.html

# download_cookbooks = "never"

# api_get_requests is an optional list of API GET requests that are made during the chef-client run.
# This is used to simulate the API requests that the cookbooks would make.
# For example, it can make Chef Search or data bag item requests.
# The values can be either full URLs that include the chef_server_url portion or just the portion of
# the URL that comes after the chef_server_url.
# For example, to make a Chef Search API request that searches for all nodes you can use either of the
# following values:
#
# "https://chef.example.com/organizations/orgname/search/node?q=*%253A*&sort=X_CHEF_id_CHEF_X%20asc&start=0"

# This is useful if you need to generate load to simulate validator key based bootstrapping.
# Note that the client generated will not actually be used in any requests.
